**Author**: Nicholas O'Kelley

NOTES:

- This game is just starting, so there will be many features to come. 
- Portions may become their own crates as it progresses for better modularity, but nothing is final yet.

## Motivation

A fun text adventure exploring a world of mystery and epic battles!


## Development Setup:

- Install the developer's libraries for `ncurses` and `ncursesw`

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

- Then run `cargo build` or `cargo run`
